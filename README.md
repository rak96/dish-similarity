# Dish Discovery - AI-Powered Flavor Similarity Finder

Find similar dishes near you using AI! This app analyzes the flavor profile of a dish you've enjoyed and helps you discover similar tastes at nearby restaurants using Cohere's language model and Google Maps.

## Features

- üçΩÔ∏è **AI Flavor Analysis**: Uses Cohere LLM to analyze dish flavor profiles.
- üìç **Google Places Search**: Precisely find the restaurant where you ate the dish using Google Places Autocomplete.
- üó∫Ô∏è **Location-Based Search**: Finds nearby restaurants with similar dishes based on your current location.
- üéØ **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests dishes with similar taste profiles.
- üë®‚Äçüç≥ **Specific Dish Analysis**: Select a suggested restaurant and analyze any dish from its menu.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory. You can do this easily by running:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will create a `.env.local` file with placeholders. You need to fill in your API keys.

### 2. API Keys Setup

#### Cohere API Key
- Get your key from the [Cohere Dashboard](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/).
- Add it to `COHERE_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.

#### Google Cloud API Key
You need one key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with the **Places API** and **Geocoding API** enabled.

1.  **Get the key** from the Google Cloud Console.
2.  **Enable Billing** for your project (a $200/month free credit is included).
3.  **Add the key to `.env.local` in TWO places:**
    -   `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`: Used for server-side searches.
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Used for the client-side autocomplete search box. **It must be the same key.**

Your `.env.local` should look like this:
```
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_key
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_key
```

### 3. Install Dependencies & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Enter a dish and location you've enjoyed
2. **Location Detection**: App requests user's current location
3. **Flavor Analysis**: Cohere LLM analyzes the dish's flavor profile
4. **Similarity Matching**: AI generates suggestions for similar dishes
5. **Restaurant Search**: Google Places API finds nearby restaurants
6. **Results Display**: Shows flavor analysis, suggestions, and nearby options

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **AI**: Cohere Language Model
- **Location Services**: Google Places API, Browser Geolocation
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `COHERE_API_KEY`
   - `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`
4. Deploy!

The app is optimized for Vercel deployment with:
- Serverless API routes
- Automatic HTTPS
- Global CDN
- Easy environment variable management

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## API Endpoints

### `/api/similarity` (POST)
Analyzes dish flavor profile and generates similar dish suggestions.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "dish": "Spicy Boys Chicken",
  "location": "Austin, TX",
  "userLocation": {
    "latitude": 30.2672,
    "longitude": -97.7431

}
```

### `/api/nearby` (POST)
Finds nearby restaurants serving similar dishes.

**Request Body:**
```json

    "latitude": 30.2672,
    "longitude": -97.7431
  },
  "radius": 8000
}
```

## Development

```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- Client-side location requests require user permission
- Google Places API key should be restricted to specific APIs
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production
